We are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to our package with the addition of the new refund method. This feature empowers developers by providing a streamlined way to process refunds within their applications. With the simple yet versatile refund method, developers can effortlessly initiate refunds by specifying the payment order ID. Additionally, the method includes an optional amount parameter, allowing developers to customize the refund amount. If the amount parameter is not configured, the refund will be processed in full. This flexibility not only adds versatility to financial transactions but also enhances the overall user experience, making it easier for developers to manage transactions seamlessly. Dive into the latest version of our package to leverage this new capability and take your payment processing to the next level.
